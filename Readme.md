## Big mart Data Analysis
Data Analysis on Big Mart Dataset involved:
1) Combining test and train datasets to handle missing values and outliers
2) Performing data cleaning
3) Standardizing and Normalizing numerical columns
4) Obtaining visualizations to conduct univariate, bivariate and trivariate analysis
5) Conducting hypothesis testing with 95% confidence interval

## REQUIREMENTS:-

1) To run the .ipynb file, jupyter notebook is required. This can be downloaded through Anaconda Python distribution.
2) To install the required python libraries for analysis and prediction :
(for conda environment)
In anaconda prompt exectute the fllowing commands:
-conda install pandas
-conda install numpy
-conda install matplotlib

-conda install seaborn
(for pip environment, replace conda with pip for the above commands)

3) To run the code in Big_Mart.ipynib file, run all the cells one by one starting from the top.
4) One can do so by selecting the “cell” dropdown menu from the taskbar and clicking on “run all”
Big_Mart.ipynib is a file which can be opened through jupyter notebook, which contains the entire code
